#Ghetto Sans
My fork of an open-source typeface. Original created by the homie Justin Sloane but that dude ain't on Github so I thought it'd be chill to set this thing up.

##Original Description:
GhettoSans is an open source experimental typeface, with no numbers or punctuation, drawn in one night by [This Guy](http://justinsloane.com)(best viewed in safari or chrome, either way it probably wont work that great).
